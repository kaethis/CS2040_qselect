### Dependencies
This program requires the following modules from the Python 3.10 standard library:
```
argparse    # parser for command-line options, args and sub-commands
math        # mathematical functions (namely, ceil)
os          # misc operating system interfaces (namely, file i/o)
re          # regular expression operations
typing      # support for type hints
```

### Links
Here are some resources I found useful when developing this program:

- [argparse â€” Parser for command-line options, arguments and sub-commands](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) This program features a variety of different types of arguments made possibly by the argparse library, each with their own associated behaviour.  The documentation explains how to achieve these results.

- [Built-in Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html) Here's a definitive list of every single built-in exception Python has to offer; especially useful for when trying to determine which exception to raise is most appropriate.
